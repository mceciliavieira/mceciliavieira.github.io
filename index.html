					<p class="Sunday-font">Sunday, 26 February 2017</p>
					<p>This is my first entry, and I am so excited about this! My friends are always asking me about music and books, which pretty much makes up my life. And so I figured out that it would be a good idea to set up a blog to share which pages I've been turning and what's been on my earphones on my Monmouth mornings.</p>
					<p> This blog is also an attempt to get me to write. I have always wanted to do it, but you all know how hard I am on myself, and how difficult it can be to find the time to do it. Hopefully, this will provide me an incentive to go on. So, without much further ado, let's get down to it.</p>
					<p class="margin-none">On music. Close friends will know why I can't get over Elbow's latest album, "Little Fictions". I had never heard about them, so this was a complete surprise. Probably the best musical one since Mary introduced me to James Blake (thank you, Mary!!). These guys managed to merge my two loves - music & fiction - with wonderful sensitivity, wrapped around a Manchester languor. The title song is absolutely beautiful. When I heard the lead singer saying that "we create our little fictions, as if it's all we are", I was sold.  Many thinkers have elaborated on how humans are bundles of stories, walking narratives made up of language. So, thank you, Elbow, for finding a gentler way of phrasing that. And with no foundational shake-ups.. "Gentle Storm" and "All Disco" are now house favourites. I'll leave you with the last one. It's perfect for a Sunday morning..</p>

					<p class="margin-top margin-none">I'm getting ready for a rainy Monday, or so The Weather Channel tells me (surprise, surprise.. it's London!). My week will begin with a conference in Whitechapel, and I'm counting on Tom Misch to ease me out of bed. "Follow", from his latest EP "Reverie", has the perfect tempo for that. And Misch can come in handy for your Friday nights too, just listen to "Watch me Dance". I read somewhere that he is 21-years-old. Some people are just born to groove, what can I say?</p>

					<p class="margin-top margin-none">Now, to books. But before I delve into it, it's worth mentioning that I am slowly entering into dissertation mode. I guess this means that this blog's balance will progressively tilt towards notes. Unless I hear clamour for Seyla Benhabib and Talal Asad from you. Guess not, right? Okay.. For now, the fiction time I have in my hands has been devoted to "To Kill a Mocking Bird", by Harper Lee and to "The Unbearable Lightness of Being", by Milan Kundera.</p>

					<p class="margin-top margin-none">Obama led me to Harper Lee's work. Remember how much I talked about his "show up, dive in and stay at it" line? His farewell address made a real impression on me, and because Atticus Finch was directly cited, I just felt like now was the time to read the book. I've been captivated by the Finches. Scout has a mind of her own, and Jem seems like a gentleman in the making. I catch myself sighing over Atticus.. Do you think men like that are still around?</p>
